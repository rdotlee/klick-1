# Klick

Klick is an automated "dinner with strangers" app. Users can sign up and fill out basic profile information and sign up for events. The app will organize random groups within events based on profile information. The grouping optimized for the highest average randomness. 

#### Basic user flow:
1. User signs up and fills out basic profile
2. User registers for events. 
3. The user's group is hidden until the event date is within the release frame. For example, if a dinner event is at 5pm and the release frame is 1 hour, the user will be able to see who they are eatgin with at 4pm.
4. A calendar invite is automatically sent to the user.
5. The user attends the event
